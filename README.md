startup_namer app
==================================

Starter code for the third independent project for Android Basics in Kotlin

Introduction
------------

In this codelab, I create a simple mobile Flutter app and include interactivity. I also create a second page (called a route) that the user can navigate to. Finally, I modify the app's theme (color). If you're familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with Dart, mobile, or web programming.

What I learned
--------------

- How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android, and the web
- Basic structure of a Flutter app
- Finding and using packages to extend functionality
- Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle
- How to implement a stateful widget
- How to create an infinite, lazily loaded list
